    <h1>5 Fascinating Facts About Ravens</h1>

    <p>The dark, mysterious raven has been depicted in literature and legends through the ages. In some parts of the world
      the raven is a sign of death or misfortune; to others its presence indicates good fortune. We shed some light on this
      mystifying creature and reveal some facts you may not have known.</p>

    <h2>1.	Ravens are playful creatures.</h2>
    <p>Ravens are acrobats in the sky. They surf updrafts, fly upside down and even turn somersaults, just because they can.
      Young ravens have been seen playing a fun game of catch by dropping sticks while in flight and then quickly swooping to catch
      it before it hits the ground.</p> </div>
    <div class= "fact2">

    <h2>2.	Ravens can talk and sing.</h2>
    <p>They have a vast repertoire of 100 or more vocalizations. With their deep voice, ravens can mimic human speech and singing and
      can imitate other bird sounds. They call to inform their mate to join them when food is found.</p> </div>
    <div class= "fact3">
  <!--  <img src= "ravens3.jpg" alt="" style="float:left";>-->
    <h2>3.	Ravens are clever and intelligent.</h2>
    <p>These clever and cunning birds often work as a pair to acquire food. One raven will lure a parent bird away from its nest, while
      the other swoops in to feed on the eggs or hatchlings. Ravens have been known to call and lead wolves to a carcass to tear through
      the tough animal hide, so it can easily dine on the soft innards. These smart birds have been known to pull an ice fisherman’s line up
      from the icy waters and dine on the caught fish.</p> </div>
    <div class= "fact4">
  <!--  <img src= "ravens4.jpg" alt="" style="float:right";>-->
    <h2>4.	Ravens eat anything they want.</h2>
    <p>Being omnivores, ravens generally eat anything available. Ravens will dine on roadkill, or hunt their own prey for dinner. They also eat
      insects, eggs, seeds and berries, and even dung. These intelligent birds are known to store extra food away in secret hiding places for later.
      If a raven senses that another raven is watching where it is about to hide food, it will pretend to stash the food in one place, but will
      actually hide it in a different spot.<p> </div>

    <h2>5.	The Raven in Legend, Literature and Lore</h2>
    <p>The raven has been symbolically depicted in literature and legends throughout history in cultures around the world. In the famous poem,
      The Raven, Edgar Allan Poe refers to the raven that taps on the narrator’s chamber door on a dark December night as a “grim, ungainly,
      ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore.” The bird’s ability to speak is revealed throughout the poem as the raven says “nevermore.”
      The raven’s appearance at midnight symbolizes death and a painful reminder of the lonely and sorrowful state of the narrator.</p> </div>
